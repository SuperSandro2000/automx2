== LDAP support

automx2 supports looking up user account data using LDAP.
This is typically used to find users' login IDs for IMAP/SMTP authentication given an associated email address.
Note that this is an optional configuration element commonly used by larger organisations.
For smaller user bases, using <<placeholders,placeholders>> may be sufficient.

The following partial LDIF snippet shows how a mail account can be defined in a widely used LDAP schema:

[source,ldif]
----
dn: uid=jdoe,ou=mailusers,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
objectClass: organizationalPerson
objectClass: person
objectClass: posixAccount
objectClass: top
cn: John Doe
givenName: John
homeDirectory: /var/maildata/jdoe
mail: johndoe@example.com
sn: Doe
uid: jdoe
uidNumber: 4321
[... more attributes here ...]
----

In order to allow automx2 to connect, an entry similar to the following needs to be created in the database:

[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO ldapserver (
    id, name, port, use_ssl,
    search_base, search_filter, attr_uid, attr_cn,
    bind_password, bind_user
) VALUES (
    100, 'ldap.example.com', 636, 1,
    'ou=mailusers,dc=example,dc=com', '(mail={0})', 'uid', 'cn',
    'PASSWORD', 'cn=automx2,ou=services,dc=example,dc=com'
);
----

An encrypted connection (LDAPS) is used and the filter and attribute names are set according to the LDIF above.
It is assumed that `cn=automx2,ou=services,dc=example,dc=com` with the given password is permitted read-only access to the necessary LDAP records/attributes.
The search filter needs to contain the placeholder `{0}` which will be replaced with the email address used as the lookup key.

Values of the LDAP attributes specified using `attr_uid` and `attr_cn` will be returned as the resulting login ID and common name, respectively. If your users are required to login using their email address instead of a technical user ID, and based on the example LDIF above, set `attr_uid` to _mail_ instead of _uid_:

[source,sql]
----
UPDATE ldapserver SET attr_uid='mail' WHERE id=100;
----

Now all that is left is to connect the example.com domain to LDAP server ID 100:

[source,sql]
----
UPDATE domain SET ldapserver_id=100 WHERE name='example.com';
----
